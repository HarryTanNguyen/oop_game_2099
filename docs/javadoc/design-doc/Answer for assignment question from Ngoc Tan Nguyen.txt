Q: How does an actor follow another actor

Answer:
To make an actor follow another actor. First, we have a class called "Follow Behaviour" 
which is already in game package. This class implements "Action Factory" class and have 
constructor with the parameter is the target actor that it has to follow. It also has 
function to determine whether it should follow its target every turn 
and which direction it should go next, if so we return MoverActorAction to move actor closer to target. 
Actor classes which have behaviour of following another actor, for example Goons, Grunts...,
have function called "addBehaviour" and we call this function in constructor of classes to add new behavior 
to list of "Action Factory" type. So every turn, it will get "Follow Behavior" from list of action then execute 
its behaviour.
