Question: How does an actor follow another actor?

Ans: In the game package, there is a class called FollowBehaviour. This FollowBehaviour class implements the 
ActionFactory interface. When we want to make an actor follow another actor (eg. Making a grunt follow the player), 
we use the grunt object created in the main application java file to call for ActionFactory. 
Using ActionFactory, we call for add function to add a new action. In the parameter of the add function, 
we throw in a newly created FollowBehaviour object. And in the parameter of the FollowBehaviour object, 
we throw in the player as the target. As such, when the code is being run in application, we will have the 
grunt object calling for ActionFactory, in which a new action under FollowBehaviour is added with player being
 the target and inside this FollowBehaviour, there is a getAction function which compares the grunt’s and the
 player’s location, and check if any of the exits movable by grunts will get it closer to the player. If so, 
  grunt moves to that location, achieving the idea of grunt following player (via making grunt move closer to 
  the player).
